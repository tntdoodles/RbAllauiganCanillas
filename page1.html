                <p>*The short descriptions here are simply short descriptions or placeholders for the content of the website that is currently not yet finished. The official website content will be available by the next week or next next week project commit. The authors of the website must also dedicate time to researching true and reliable content besides developing the layout of the website. We hope you would understand.</p>
                <p>Meanings of the letters: This section would be expounding on the acronym and the sexualities mentioned in it.</p>
                <p>Examples of other genders and sexualities not in the acronym but in the spectrum: Of course, we shouldn't only mention the basics because we really want to dive deep into the LGBTQ+ spectrum and be inclusive of the other sides of the spectrum. However, we wouldn't be explaining every single gender and sexuality in the spectrum because there's infinitely too many to be mentioned. We would only be focusing on 10 other examples of those under the spectrum. The full list of those to be tackled is unavailable at the moment, but will be included in the next project progress commit. </p>
                <p>Short history of the term and some revolutionary figures: There are many variations of the acronym LGBTQ+ that have been and is still continuously being developed by those in the community. It is important that we take a look into these because it is directly linked with the history and development of not only the term but the community itself. Speaking of the history of the LGBTQ+ community, there are many revolutionary figures, both historical and contemporary, who have been and will continue fighting for the community's rights and have done lots for its development. We will be discussing 5 revolutionary historical figures and 5 revolutionary contemporary figures who are part of the LGBTQ+ spectrum. This will be limited to those under the spectrum only: of course, allies are important but we must shine light on those who actually identify under it.</p>
