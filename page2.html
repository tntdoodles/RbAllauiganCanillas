                <p>Homophobia then and homophobia now: People in the community have experienced homophobia and discrimination for many centuries now. Unfortunately, until now, queer people still experience the same injustices and are still a minority in our community. This section would be highlighting some examples or prejudices and hate crimes committed by close-minded individuals who continue to discriminate against the community.</p>
                <p>LGBTQ+ rights: Millions of queer people have been fighting just to get basic human rights for thousands of years now, which shouldn’t be the case. Sexual orientation and gender identity are integral parts of our identities and selves and it shouldn’t be a reason for discrimination and marginalization. This section exists solely for promoting LGBTQ+ rights and awareness, and additionally, what you should do if your or any queer person’s rights have been violated.</p>
