# L.O.G.I.C.: Learning Orientations and Gender Identities Campaign
Millions of people around the world identify under the queer spectrum. Although there are areas that are now more accepting and supportive of the community, many more treat them as a minority and subject them to harsh and unfair treatment. Due to the significant lack of accessible SOGIE education, many are intolerant and narrow-minded towards them. As a nation, we must continue to grow and develop our education and our attitudes towards those in the community. After all, your identity shouldn't be something you should be discriminated against. We hope that this website can help to educate and spread awareness, debunk some famous myths and encourage people to be more accepting and supportive.
