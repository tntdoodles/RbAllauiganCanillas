                    <span><h1 style="margin: 0;">The Project</h1>Millions of people around the world identify under the queer spectrum. Although some areas of the world have progressed and have grown to be more accepting and supportive of the community, it is without a doubt that many more areas treat them as a minority, subjecting them to harsh environments and unfair treatments. There has also been a significant lack of accessible SOGIE education, leading to several sectors of different regions being uneducated and unaware of the LGTBQ+ community, making them intolerant and narrow-minded towards them. As we continue to grow as a nation, we must continue to grow, develop, and cultivate our education and our attitudes towards those identifying under this community; after all, having your own preferences and identities shouldn't be something you should be discriminated for.</span>

                        <p>L.O.G.I.C., or Learning Orientations and Gender Identities Campaign, is an LGBTQ+ themed website created and headed by students Mikaela Jasmine Allauigan and Alyssa Breanna Canillas of 9-Rubidium 2026. As they are both members of the LGBTQ+ community, they have decided to make their Q1 and Q2 project website about this topic.</p>
                        <p>They are both passionate about the education and awareness surrounding the queer spectrum and the individuals who identify under it. This is solely why they created this website: to make the public aware of this topic and discuss it more openly and proudly instead of dismissing it as a taboo or sensitive topic.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>As we move forward, the creators would like to emphasize that this is a work in progress that is being improved and developed step-by-step. Each piece of information that we put on this website has been thoroughly researched and rechecked before being finalized in order to ensure that there will be no spread of misinformation. In any case that there is false information present, we will hold ourselves accountable and immediately make the necessary changes. Should there be any problems regarding the interface as well, recommendations will be accepted and edits will be made. We hope that our viewers will understand.</p>
                        <p>L.O.G.I.C. is a product of passion and perseverance. We hope that you will like the website as much as we like it. As you finish going through the website, we hope that you have learned at least one new thing about the LGBTQ+ community. We hope that a passion for fighting for equal rights has been ignited in your souls. Finally, we hope that, moving forward, you will continue to be a good member, ally, or activist for the queer spectrum. Remember that you are loved, appreciated, and accepted, no matter what you identify as. Enjoy going through L.O.G.I.C.! â™¥</p>
