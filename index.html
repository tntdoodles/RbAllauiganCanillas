                <p>Millions of people around the world identify under the queer spectrum. Although some areas of the world have progressed and have grown to be more accepting and supportive of the community, it is without a doubt that many more areas treat them as a minority, subjecting them to harsh environments and unfair treatments. There has also been a significant lack of accessible SOGIE education, leading to several sectors of different regions being uneducated and unaware of the LGTBQ+ community, making them intolerant and narrow-minded towards them. As we continue to grow as a nation, we must continue to grow, develop, and cultivate our education and our attitudes towards those identifying under this community; after all, having your own preferences and identities shouldn't be something you should be discriminated for.</p>
                <p>This website is all about the LGBTQ+ spectrum. This would be tackling what exactly it is, the social conflicts surrounding it, and what we, as members and supporters, can do to help. Additionally, it would briefly discuss the LGBTQ+ situation in the Philippines, like the widely discussed SOGIE bill. Finally, it would showcase revolutionary LGBTQ+ icons, and the important terminologies under this topic. We hope that this website can help to educate and spread awareness, debunk some famous myths, and make people around more accepting and supportive.</p>
