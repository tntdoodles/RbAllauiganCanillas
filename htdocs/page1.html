                <span><h1 style="margin: 0;">SOGIE</h1> meaning sexual orientation and gender identity expression, refers to characteristics common to all human beings, as these facets are integral to our identities and lives as individuals. Although commonly associated with LGBTQ+, everybody, even cisgender heterosexuals, has a SOGIE. The LGBTQ+ spectrum, on the other hand, falls under SOGIE. Individuals under this umbrella identify themselves as <a href="#lesbian">lesbian</a>, <a href="#gay">gay</a>, <a href="#bisexual">bisexual</a>, <a href="#transgender">transgender</a>, and <a href="#questioning">questioning</a>, among many <a href="#other">other genders and sexualities</a>. Those in the spectrum can also be referred to as "queer".</span>

            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>Lesbianism was the first in the acronym which gained its name, dating back to ancient Greek works and a more modern use which then emerged in the 1890s. Homosexuality and bisexuality were then terms coined by a journalist in 1869, and gay was then used widely in the late 1960s, as activitists reclaimed this decade-old slur. As the acronym LGB was being more commonly used and popularized, the term transgender came into being in 1965. This then formed the acronym LGBT, which became widespread by the 2000s. </p>
            <p>Other variations of the acronym include LGBTQ/+, LGBTQIA.+, and even LGBTQQIP2SAA, among many others. These acronyms get expanded further for inclusivity. However, for this website, this community or spectrum will be referred to as LGBTQ+.</p>
